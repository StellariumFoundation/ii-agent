# Since BaseAgent is just "class BaseAgent(LLMTool): pass",
# its testability depends heavily on LLMTool.
# LLMTool requires name, description, input_schema for concrete tools.
# BaseAgent itself is likely intended as an abstract conceptual base for other agents,
# rather than a directly usable tool.
# If it were to be instantiated, it would need these attributes.

        # If BaseAgent is meant to be instantiated directly, it would need
        # the attributes required by LLMTool.
        # However, as it's just "pass", it won't have them unless LLMTool provides defaults
        # or BaseAgent is always subclassed.

        # Let's assume BaseAgent is not typically instantiated directly,
        # but if it were, it should inherit from LLMTool.
        self.assertTrue(issubclass(BaseAgent, LLMTool))

        # If we try to instantiate BaseAgent, it will likely fail if LLMTool's __init__
        # or subsequent usage expects 'name', 'description', 'input_schema' to be defined
        # on the class or instance, and they are not on BaseAgent.

        # Example: A concrete LLMTool requires these:
        # class MyTool(LLMTool):
        #     name = "my_tool"
        #     description = "my tool desc"
        #     input_schema = {}
        #     def run_impl(self, ...): ...

        # BaseAgent doesn't define these.
        # If LLMTool.__init__ itself doesn't require them, instantiation might pass.
        # If LLMTool methods (like get_tool_param) are called on a BaseAgent instance,
        # they would fail if they try to access self.name etc.

        # For the purpose of this test, we'll just confirm its parentage.
        # A more practical test would involve a concrete agent inheriting from BaseAgent.
        # If BaseAgent had any methods, we would test them here.

        # If LLMTool's __init__ is simple (e.g. just super().__init__() or pass),
        # then BaseAgent() might be instantiable.
        # Let's try, assuming LLMTool might have a basic init.
        try:
            agent = BaseAgent()
            # If it instantiates, it implies LLMTool allows it without predefined name/desc/schema at instance level.
            # This is a weak test as it depends on LLMTool's structure.
            self.assertIsInstance(agent, BaseAgent)
        except TypeError as e:
