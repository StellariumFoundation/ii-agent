        # Important: The `websocket` object used in the side_effect is the one from
        # `client.websocket_connect()`. This is a client-side representation.
        # For `put_nowait` to send a message that `websocket.receive_json()` can get,
        # it implies that `put_nowait` is effectively short-circuiting the server's
        # send mechanism and directly injecting into the client's receive buffer,
        # or that the TestClient's websocket is designed to allow this kind of server-side
        # send simulation if the object is passed around.
        # More typically, the server would use its own WebSocket connection object to send.
        # This specific pattern relies on how TestClient and its WebSocket client work.
        # If `websocket.send_json` only sends client-to-server, this won't work as intended.
        # Let's test this assumption. A more robust mock would involve the server's
        # WebSocket object, but that's harder to get here.
        #
        # Alternative: `agent_instance.start_message_processing` is mocked.
        # The actual `_process_messages` in `ws_server.py` takes `websocket` as an argument.
        # If `start_message_processing` was not mocked, or if its mock was more detailed,
        # it could use the real websocket.
        # For now, let's assume put_nowait can be made to effectively send to client's receive queue.
        # This is a common pattern in testing FastAPI websockets with TestClient if you
        # want to simulate server-sent events without fully running the server's async loops.

        # Let's try to make the mocked agent's `run_agent` method itself "send" the event
        # by calling `put_nowait` which then has a side effect.
        # The `run_agent` in `AnthropicFC` does call `put_nowait`.

        def put_nowait_side_effect(event_to_send):
            # This function is called by the (mocked) agent's business logic
            # when it wants to queue a message for the client.
            # We use the client's websocket object to send this message back to the client,
            # simulating the server's _process_messages task.
            # Note: This relies on TestClient's websocket allowing such "loopback" or direct send.
            # Starlette's TestClient websocket's `send_json` sends to the server.
            # `receive_json` receives from the server.
            # This side_effect, if it calls `websocket.send_json(event_to_send.model_dump())`,
            # would be the *client* sending another message to the server. This is not what we want.

            # Correct approach: The server side code (`_process_messages`) is responsible for
            # taking from agent's queue and sending to *its connected client*.
            # Since `start_message_processing` (which starts `_process_messages`) is mocked,
            # that critical part is missing.
            #
            # The `test_ws_cancel_message` *does* expect an event (AGENT_CANCELLED)
            # which is put on the queue by `agent.cancel()` and then presumably sent by
            # the mocked `_process_messages` (or its remnants).
            # Let's re-examine `client_fixture`:
            # `mock_agent_instance.start_message_processing = MagicMock(return_value=AsyncMock())`
            # This means the real `_process_messages` in `ws_server.py` is NOT called.
            #
            # So, for this test to work, we need to simulate the message being sent.
            # The simplest way is to have `run_agent` (when called by server thread)
            # somehow signal the main test thread to send it, or have a shared list.

            # Let's try a simpler simulation first:
            # The `run_agent_async` function in `ws_server.py` is what gets the query.
            # It runs `agent.run_agent` in a thread.
            # If `agent.run_agent` puts something on `agent.message_queue`,
            # the (currently mocked away) `_process_messages` should send it.

            # If `test_ws_cancel_message` works, it means AGENT_CANCELLED (put on queue by agent.cancel())
            # *is* somehow making it to `websocket.receive_json()`.
            # This implies that `mocks["agent_instance"].message_queue.put_nowait` is called,
            # and the `_process_messages` task, even if its startup is mocked, might still be
            # partially effective if the queue object is shared.
            # This is unlikely. `start_message_processing` returns a new AsyncMock task.
            # The real `_process_messages` in `ws_server.py` is `async def _process_messages(websocket: WebSocket, agent: AnthropicFC):`
            # This means the `websocket_endpoint` in `ws_server.py` creates this task.
            # `agent_connection.start_message_processing(websocket, agent)`
            # Ah, `agent_connection` is `ActiveAgentConnection` which is not mocked itself.
            # `ActiveAgentConnection.start_message_processing` calls `asyncio.create_task(_process_messages(websocket, agent))`.
            # So, the REAL `_process_messages` from `ws_server.py` IS RUNNING with the REAL websocket!
            # The mock `agent.start_message_processing` in the fixture is for the *agent's own* loop, if any, not the server's.
            # This is good news.

            # So, we just need `agent.run_agent` to call `agent.message_queue.put_nowait`
