# Core II-Agent and server dependencies
fastapi
uvicorn[standard] 
websockets # For the embedded server prototype and potentially for FastAPI's underlying use
sqlalchemy
psycopg2-binary # If PostgreSQL is an option (often good to list as a common DB driver)
anthropic # The main LLM client
openai # For other LLM models or tools
google-cloud-aiplatform # For Vertex AI
tiktoken # For token counting with OpenAI/Anthropic

# Tooling and data handling
pydantic[email] # For data validation and settings
jsonschema # For tool input schema validation
anyio # Used by FastAPI and for async operations
python-dotenv # For .env file loading
requests # For web requests by tools
beautifulsoup4 # For HTML parsing by tools (e.g., visit_webpage)
playwright # For browser automation tools (large dependency, consider if essential for initial self-contained version)
PyPDF2 # If PDFTextExtractTool uses this (or pdfminer.six)
pdfminer.six # Alternative for PDF extraction
Pillow # For image processing if any tools do that
tavily-python # If Tavily search is used
google-api-python-client # If Google search/other Google APIs are used by tools
newspaper3k # Often used for article scraping
soundfile # If audio tools process raw audio files
numpy # Often a dependency for media/data processing tools

# Note: Specific versions are omitted for now. PyInstaller will typically bundle
# the versions available in the environment where it's run.
# This list should be reviewed and refined during the PyInstaller setup phase (Phase D)
# as missing dependencies or hidden imports are discovered.
# Dependencies for tools that are conditionally loaded (e.g., based on tool_args)
# also need to be included if those tools are intended to be part of the bundled app.
# For example, if specific database drivers beyond psycopg2 are needed, add them.
# Ensure that when running PyInstaller, it's in an environment where these are installed.
